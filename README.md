# Book API (Express.js)

This is a basic REST API built with Node.js and Express.js.

## What I Did

- Initialized the project using `npm init`.
- Installed Express with `npm install express`.
- Created a simple server running on port 3000.
- Used an in-memory array to store book data (`id`, `title`, `author`).
- Added the following API routes:
  - `GET /books` – returns all books
  - `POST /books` – adds a new book
  - `PUT /books/:id` – updates a book by ID
  - `DELETE /books/:id` – deletes a book by ID
- Tested all routes using Postman.
